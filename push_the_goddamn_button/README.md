## to do

* figure out web sockets
* persist counter
    * got this working in main.py
    * simple.py loses the count with each deploy
    * txt_db.py was an attempt to use a .txt file as the db. would like to figure out how to make this work but the value would get reset to what is checked into git whenever i re-deployed
